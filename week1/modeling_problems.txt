Modelling problems:
1. Ambiguity about the ethnicity or nationality of a person.
Solution: We don't take this into account. 
2. Ambiguity about the colour of an object.
Solution: We only take the most common colours into account, i.e. all different shades and variations of blue are just annotated as 'blue'.
3. The amount of objects that we take into account; which are relevant?
Solution: We try to think as a user: which queries am I interested in. 
4. To what extent do we subdivide an item into its parts? 
Solution: We don't subdivide an item, unless we think the part is very relevant (see 3.) an almost an separate item by itself.
5. If we are not sure what an object is. 
Solution: We make assumptions of what we think is the most obvious. (e.g. Cup of coffee on wood. Assumption: the cup of coffee is on a table)

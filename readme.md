## Project 1, Group 1: Hypernym Generation

Task: Extend first-order models automatically by adding (automatically) more general concepts based on WordNet's hypernym relations.

Members: Remko Boschker, Leonardo Velozo, Joost Doornkamp, Gunnar Gerstenkorn

If the domain list is in the entity hypernym, then we are done.

Chose to use nltk / python instead of prolog, because of ease of use.

Leonardo wrote a basic script to extract hypernyms. Joost will write a wrapper loading the models and writing out the modified ones.

We wonder if this is all there is to the assignemnt.
